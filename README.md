# Mappit

**Mappit** is a tool that automatically generates mappings making correspondences between the target ontology and heterogeneous source data (i.e. JSON, CSV, XML and RDBs). It relies on the ontology constructs to build the mapping structure and distance metrics for making the correspondences to the data, producing both RML and R2RML mappings.
